# A Simple Example on Reinforcement Learning (RL)
This example demonstrates the effectiveness, though on small scale, of 
reinforcement learning in a control system. This project is 
heavily inspired by the rocket example provided by Daniel Brummerloh (2020). 

This example is divided based the objective of the algorithms such as obstacles avoidance, path tracking etc.

## Objective

This example focuses on thhe following objectives:

1. obstacles avoidance
2. object pursuit
3. obstacles avoidance + object pursuit

## Dependency

The following python libraries are used:

* OpenAI Gym
* PyGame
* Matplotlib
* Keras
* all the other good ones...

## TO-DOs:

1. Refine each scripts
2. Explore the cause and effect for different reward function
3. Create a more challenging environment
