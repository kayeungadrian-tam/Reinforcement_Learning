# A Simple Example on Reinforcement Learning (RL)

This example demonstrates the effectiveness, though on as scale, of reinforcement learning in a control system proces. This example is heavily inspired by the rocket example provided by [Daniel Brummerloh (2020)](https://towardsdatascience.com/ultimate-guide-for-reinforced-learning-part-1-creating-a-game-956f1f2b0a91). This example is divided based the objective of the algorithms such as obstacles avoidance, path tracking etc.

## Objective

This example focuses on thhe following objectives:

1. obstacles avoidance
2. object pursuit
3. obstacles avoidance + object pursuit

## Dependency

The following python libraries are used:

* OpenAI Gym
* PyGame
* Matplotlib
* Keras
* all the other good ones...

## TO-DOs:

1. Refine each scripts
2. Explore the cause and effect for different reward function
3. Create a more challenging environment
